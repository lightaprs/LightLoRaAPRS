Main purpose of this basic software is to demonstrate capabilities of [LightTracker Plus 1.0](https://github.com/lightaprs/LightTracker-Plus-1.0) Every LightTracker Plus module is shipped with this firmware so you can start playing with your device immediately.

LightLoRaAPRS is an single firmware contains Tracker, iGate (Gateway) and Digi (Router) features. So you don't have to install a different firmware to switch from Tracker to iGate. All you need is to activate configuration mode and access to configuration page using your computer or smartphone via Wi-Fi. You will find more info about the software soon on Wiki page.

Also I am not planing to improve or add new features to this software. Ricardo Guzman is doing a great job and developing a great LoRa APRS software. So I hope he supports LightTracker Plus soon using this repo and so we can focus on designing new modules :)
